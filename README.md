  <h3>Overview of Dataset</h3>
  <p>The dataset focuses on technology tags based on Developer Stories from Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is a Q&A platform that allows developers to ask questions, learn, and share technical knowledge. Developer Story allows users to share what they have worked on by linking features they worked on, blog posts, or public code. Essentially, it allows for users to share their most proud work. 

The dataset is stored in a csv file, with three variables, represented as columns: Source, Target, and Value. Source is the technology tag, Target is the other technology tag, and Value is weight representing the frequency of co-occurrence of the two tags, indicating how often these tags are used together in application development.</p>
  
  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <li>To identify which tags, hold strong and weak significance in the network.
  <li>To identify the relationship between nodes and edges and apply to real-world applications.
  <li>To identify why isolated communities exist and apply to real-world applications.

  
  <h3>Social Network Analysis and Visualization</h3>
  <p>The technology tags represent various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Using GenerativeAI (ChatGPT), we categorized the nodes and edges to identify for any commonalities that we may use the analysis. Some of these tags may overlap with more than one category.
